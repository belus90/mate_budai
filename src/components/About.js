    <h2>About me </h2>
    <p>I'm in the process of completing a 16-week professional software development course at CodeClan, 
        focusing on three program languages: Python, JavaScript and Java.
        I'm currently looking for a new opportunity in the industry to utilise and further develop my professional skills 
        and knowledge. I'm a qualified Electrical Engineer with an HND and a Bachelor's degree, therefore, 
        I have experience working with C++ and MPLAB programme languages as well.</p>
